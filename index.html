        <h2>What is this website?</h2>
        <p>When studying, one area I that never fully felt confident in was Big O notation. I understood it but not as
            well
            as I would have liked to. Additionally, I knew the different sorting algorithms but would not be able to
            tell
            you when you should use one and not the other. So this website is an attempt to expand and solidify my
            knowledge
            and to also provide a resource for people like me who feel that they could understand this topic a little
            better, or who would like to use it as a revision/refresher tool.</p>
